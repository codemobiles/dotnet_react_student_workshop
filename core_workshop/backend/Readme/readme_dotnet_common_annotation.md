In .NET API development, common annotations include:

1. **[ApiController]**:

   - Marks a class as a Web API controller.
   - Provides features like automatic model validation and improved route handling.
   - Helps with error responses and parameter binding.

2. **[Route]**:

   - Defines the routing template for the controller or action methods.
   - Used to map HTTP requests to specific actions.
   - Can include placeholders for parameters (e.g., `[Route("api/[controller]")]`).

3. **[HttpGet], [HttpPost], [HttpPut], [HttpDelete]**:

   - Specify the HTTP method for an action method.
   - Directs incoming requests to the appropriate method based on the HTTP verb.

4. **[FromBody], [FromQuery], [FromRoute], [FromHeader], [FromForm]**:

   - Specify the source of data binding for action parameters.
   - `FromBody`: Binds from the request body.
   - `FromQuery`: Binds from query string parameters.
   - `FromRoute`: Binds from route data.
   - `FromHeader`: Binds from HTTP headers.
   - `FromForm`: Binds from form data.

5. **[Produces]**:
   - Indicates the type of response a controller or action can produce.
   - Helps with content negotiation and generating API documentation.

These annotations help define and manage how API controllers handle HTTP requests and responses in a structured and maintainable way.
